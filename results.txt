Training and validation results after one epoch of training

Selecting model for training with sparse switchable normalization:

The first model is first trained from scratch to show improved performance with pretrained VoxelNet model (296,960 iterations). All other models are pretrained.

prec@10: precision at top 10 predictions
rec@10: recall at top 10 predictions
mAP: mean average precision
NDS: nuScenes detection score (see https://www.nuscenes.org/object-detection?externalData=all&mapData=all&modalities=Any)
